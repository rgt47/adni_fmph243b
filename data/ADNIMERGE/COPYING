Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 
2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical 
Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private 
pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public
private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological 
markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure 
the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended 
to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their 
effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. 

The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center 
and University of California  –  San  Francisco.  ADNI  is  the  result  of  efforts of 
many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and 
subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial 
goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research  –
approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 
people with MCI to be followed for 3 years and 200 people with early AD to be followed 
for 2 years. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.
